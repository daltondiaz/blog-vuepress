# Naive Bayes

This is my first time write a english tutorial about machine learning, so why I will begin by Naive Bayes? Because is simple and is first thing learning in the course [Intro do Machine Learning](udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) in Udacity, so if you want more details, go to the course. When I finish the course vou write about.

Naive Bayes is a classifier based on applying Bayes Theorem. Its used in text categorization, for exemplo to classify a e-mail if is spam or legitime, indentify who is the owner of the e-mail.

For use this classifier you don't need now understand the math behind them, but in the future you need understand because is essential for um professional.

## Bayes Theorem

$P(A|B) = {P(A|B)*P(A) \over P(B)}$ 

## Example 1

## Example 2
