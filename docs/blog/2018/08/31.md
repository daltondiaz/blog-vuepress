# Begin of my Journey in Artificial Intellegence

This is my first post in my blog, so I decide writing about my path in study AI and this post will be generaly.

## Motivation 

Today with a little skill and experience in development of software we can impact and gain value in the officer, society and life of thounsand people.

The minimal things what I hear about **AI** was detection of object and people in images, self driver cars, find patterns in data to predict future events.

I think it's facinating you create a something a little intelligent like human where can change the enviorment.

So I decide, *"I want development software more intelligent and have a better impact in life of people."*

## First Steps

I think for you learning something new you need follow people who study, working and talking about the subject, so I begin search in google and youtube about the theme and I found a lot of content. 

This can be your first step too.

## What's AI?

A good definition to AI is:
 
> Artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[1] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".

AI ins't a new theme, your research begin in 1960s (too old), but happen a boom in 2000s beacuse of amount of data (Big Data) what you can obtein data from everything.

Similiar to other area from Computer Science has many divisions:

- Machine Learning 
- Deep Learning
- Neural Networks
- NPL or Natural Processing Language

I want to initiate my journey with Machine Learning and after focues in Deep Learning and Neural Networks, so for now I'll only talk about Machine Learning, in the future writing and play with Deep Learning and share the content with everyone.

## Machine Learning

### What's ML?



### Why ML?

### But I don't know math

You don't need now math in deep, but in the beggin its recomendade to learning about probability and linear algebra and matrix calculus and can learning together with development of  

Recentily I read this post, [Learning Math for Machine Learning](https://blog.ycombinator.com/learning-math-for-machine-learning/) this can be you first steps.


### Who Use ML?



## Makert 

Nowaday have many Company and Startups investing in AI around the world.
